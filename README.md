# Discord-Bot-which-syps-on-your-friends-server
## How does it work
It takes the messages sent on another server's channels and post it on you server's specific channel that you mention 

## How to set it up
First of all you need to put the channels ID's in the variables (DO NOT USE INVERTED COMMA'S). In ```channel_which_you_want_to_spy_on``` put the channel ID that you want to spy on. In ```channel_which_the_messages_will_be_sent_on```you need to put the channel Id that you want the messages sent to.

You need to add this bot to the server you want to spy on and on your server

## Using the bot
